# Understanding Git

This repo was used to allow me learn how version control works.

## What I learned:
- Learned the use of `git init` to initialize a remote repository.
- Learned how to use other git commands like:
  ```
   git add
   git commit
   git push
   git pull
   git merge
   git remote add
   git remote rename
   git checkout <branch_name>
   git checkout -b <branch_name>
  ```
 - also learned how to resolve conflicts.
